## VRC Status
- Value Score: 25%
- Verified: 2/8
- Blocked: 0
- Recommendation: CONTINUE
- Summary: Epic 1 remains at 25% value delivery (2/8 deliverables verified: Astro project setup and Tailwind blue theme). The project has a working build pipeline and correctly configured blue color scheme, but is missing ALL user-facing components: no shadcn/ui library, no layout system, no header/footer navigation, no mobile menu, only 1 of 6 pages (bare stub), and no responsive design. Progress has been stalled for iterations 6-10 with no_progress on service_fix and generate_qc actions. All 6 undelivered items are covered by existing tasks (1.2 through 1.8) -- the critical path is task 1.2 (shadcn setup) which unblocks everything downstream. No new tasks needed; execution must resume on task 1.2.

## Tasks
- [x] **1.1**: Initialize Astro 5 project with React integration, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS v4. Run npm create astro, install @astrojs/react, then install tailwindcss and @tailwindcss/vite. Configure astro.config.mjs with React integration and Tailwind via vite.plugins (not @astrojs/tailwind which is deprecated for Tailwind v4). Create src/styles/globals.css with @import tailwindcss directive. Set up tsconfig.json. Verify npm run dev starts and npm run build produces dist/ output.
- [ ] **1.2**: Set up shadcn/ui with blue B2B theme. Run npx shadcn@latest init (Astro framework). Configure CSS variables in globals.css using @theme directive for blue primary (#1e40af), slate text, white/gray backgrounds per PRD 4.1. Tailwind v4 uses CSS-based config (@theme), not tailwind.config.mjs. Install cn utility in src/lib/utils.ts. Add core shadcn components: Button, Card, Input, Textarea, Label, Badge, Separator.
- [ ] **1.3**: Create BaseLayout.astro with HTML shell: doctype, lang, charset, viewport meta, globals.css import, Inter font stack (system font fallback), and a <slot /> for page content. Include shared head elements (favicon link, default title/description). This is the wrapper every page will use.
- [ ] **1.4**: Build Header.astro with site logo/name text, desktop navigation bar linking all 6 pages (Home, How It Works, Services, About, Blog, Contact), and MobileNav.tsx React island using shadcn Sheet component for hamburger menu at <768px. Desktop nav uses horizontal links visible at >1024px. Add shadcn Sheet and NavigationMenu components if not yet installed.
- [ ] **1.5**: Build Footer.astro with navigation links to all pages, social media link placeholders (LinkedIn, Twitter), copyright text with current year, and a brief company tagline. Use Tailwind for dark background section with light text. Wire Footer into BaseLayout so it appears on every page.
- [ ] **1.6**: Create 5 page routes (excluding blog, handled in task 1.7) with placeholder content using BaseLayout. Home (index.astro): hero section with headline, subheadline, CTA button, 3 feature cards, testimonial placeholders, bottom CTA. How It Works: 4-step BEEP method placeholders. Services: 3 service sections. About: company story placeholder. Contact: form placeholder. All pages use BaseLayout with Header and Footer.
- [ ] **1.7**: Create blog/[...page].astro as the blog listing page with placeholder blog card grid (BlogCard.astro component showing image placeholder, title, date, category badges, excerpt). Use getStaticPaths with paginate() returning hardcoded placeholder posts. Build responsive grid: 1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop. Render prev/next pagination links from page.url.prev and page.url.next. Do NOT create a separate blog/index.astro -- the [...page].astro rest route serves /blog as page 1.
- [ ] **1.8**: Verify responsive layout across all breakpoints and confirm npm run build succeeds with zero errors. Check: Header desktop nav visible >1024px, hamburger <768px. All 6 pages render with blue theme. Cards stack on mobile, grid on desktop. Footer consistent. Fix any build warnings or layout breaks found.
- [ ] **2.1**: Create Sanity Studio project in sanity/ directory. Set up sanity.config.ts with project ID and dataset. Note: Sanity Studio only exposes env vars prefixed SANITY_STUDIO_ to browser code -- either hardcode project ID in config or use SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID. Create sanity.cli.ts. Add package.json with sanity and @sanity/vision dependencies. Configure npm scripts for sanity dev (port 3333). Use defineConfig from sanity, defineType/defineField for schema API. Verify npx sanity dev launches Studio UI.
- [ ] **2.2**: Create 4 Sanity TypeScript schemas in sanity/schemas/: post.ts (title, slug, author ref, publishedAt, categories refs, featuredImage with alt text, excerpt max 200 chars, body as Portable Text), author.ts (name, slug, image, bio), category.ts (title, slug, description), page.ts (title, slug, sections array with hero/features/testimonials/textBlock/cta object types per PRD 2.4). Create schemas/index.ts registering these 4 schemas. Task 2.2b handles the remaining 3 schemas (testimonial, siteSettings, navigation).
- [ ] **2.2b**: Create 3 remaining Sanity schemas: testimonial.ts (name required, company optional, role optional, quote required, image optional), siteSettings.ts (title, description, logo, socialLinks object with linkedin/twitter/facebook string fields, footerText, ctaDefaultLink), navigation.ts (items array where each item has label string, href string, optional children array of same shape). Update schemas/index.ts to register all 7 schemas (4 from task 2.2 + these 3). Verify Studio sidebar shows all 7 document types.
- [ ] **2.3**: Create Sanity client library at src/lib/sanity.ts. Configure @sanity/client with project ID, dataset, API version, and useCdn:true from env vars. Create GROQ query helpers: getAllPosts (paginated), getPostBySlug, getPostsByCategory, getAllCategories, getPageBySlug, getSiteSettings, getNavigation. Add @sanity/image-url builder for image URLs.
- [ ] **2.4**: Wire blog listing page (blog/[...page].astro) to Sanity. Replace placeholder data with real Sanity posts via getAllPosts GROQ query in getStaticPaths. Use paginate() with pageSize:10 to generate /blog, /blog/2, /blog/3 etc. Render BlogCard.astro for each post with real data (featured image via image-url, title, publishedAt formatted date, category Badges, excerpt). Prev/next links from page.url.prev/next.
- [ ] **2.5**: Create individual blog post page at blog/[slug].astro (named param, NOT rest param -- rest param [...slug] would conflict with [...page] pagination route). Use getStaticPaths to generate a page per Sanity post slug. Fetch full post data including body (Portable Text), author, categories. Render Portable Text body using astro-portabletext. Display featured image, title, author name, date, category badges. Style for long-form reading with proper typography.
- [ ] **2.6**: Create category filter pages at blog/category/[category].astro. Use getStaticPaths to generate a page per Sanity category slug. Fetch posts filtered by category via GROQ. Render same BlogCard grid layout as main blog listing. Display category title as page heading. Add CategoryFilter.tsx React island (or static Astro links) as category nav bar on blog pages.
- [ ] **2.7**: Implement graceful empty-state handling on all CMS-dependent pages. Wrap Sanity fetch calls in try/catch. Blog listing shows No posts yet when empty. Blog post returns 404 gracefully. Category pages show empty message. Home page sections show placeholder when CMS unavailable. Ensure npm run build succeeds when SANITY_PROJECT_ID is empty or invalid.
- [ ] **3.1**: Wire Home page (index.astro) to CMS content. Fetch page data from Sanity using getPageBySlug. Render hero section (headline, subheadline, CTA button), 3-4 feature cards (icon, title, description), BEEP method 4-step preview with link to How It Works, 2-3 testimonial cards from CMS, and bottom CTA banner. Fallback to placeholder content when CMS unavailable.
- [ ] **3.2**: Build How It Works page with 4-step BEEP method visual layout. Each step (Build, Engage, Educate, Promote) has number/icon, heading, 2-3 sentence description. Alternating left/right layout for visual interest. Wire to CMS page content with fallback to hardcoded BEEP descriptions. CTA button at bottom linking to discovery call.
- [ ] **3.3**: Build Services page with 3 service sections on one page: LinkedIn Marketing, Thought Leadership Marketing, LinkedIn Training. Each section has heading, description, key benefits list, and CTA link. Wire to CMS page content with fallback to hardcoded service descriptions. Professional layout with consistent spacing.
- [ ] **3.4**: Build About page (/about) and Contact page (/contact). About page: company story paragraph (founded 2014, members in 22 countries), mission statement, philosophy paragraph on systematic social selling. Wire to CMS getPageBySlug with hardcoded fallback text. CTA button at bottom linking to siteSettings.ctaDefaultLink or fallback URL. Contact page: ContactForm.tsx React island with client:load. 4 fields: name (required, text input), email (required, type=email with regex validation), company (optional, text input), message (required, textarea). On submit: POST JSON body to import.meta.env.PUBLIC_FORM_ACTION. Success state: green text Message sent. Error state: red text Something went wrong. Disable submit button while request is pending.
- [ ] **3.5**: Enhance blog post page with author bio card (name, image, bio text) at bottom and Related Posts section showing 3 posts from the same category. Fetch related posts via GROQ query filtering by shared category, excluding current post. Author bio card uses author reference data already in post query.
- [ ] **3.6**: Implement SEO across all pages. Add page-specific <title> and <meta description> to BaseLayout via props. Add Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url) and canonical URL to every page. Add Organization structured data (JSON-LD) on home page. Install @astrojs/sitemap, configure in astro.config.mjs. Create public/robots.txt allowing all crawlers with sitemap reference.
- [ ] **3.7**: Final build verification and layout consistency check. Run npm run build and confirm exit code 0. Verify in built dist/ output: all routes generate HTML files (index.html, how-it-works/index.html, services/index.html, about/index.html, contact/index.html, blog/index.html). Check every page includes Header and Footer components. Verify Tailwind blue-800 primary color (#1e40af) is applied to headings and CTAs. Fix any build errors, missing imports, or broken component references discovered during verification.
- [ ] **STRUCTURE-prd-conformance**: Create missing files from PRD directory structure: astro.config.mjs          # Astro config with React + Tailwind, tailwind.config.mjs       # Tailwind config with shadcn theme, src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro  # HTML shell, head, nav, footer, src/components/ui/               # shadcn/ui components (Button, Card, etc.), src/components/Header.astro      # Site header with navigation, src/components/Footer.astro      # Site footer with links, social, newsletter, src/components/Hero.astro        # Hero section (reusable across pages), src/components/FeatureCard.astro # Feature/benefit card, src/components/TestimonialCard.astro, src/components/BlogCard.astro    # Blog post preview card. These files are defined in the PRD but have not been created yet.
