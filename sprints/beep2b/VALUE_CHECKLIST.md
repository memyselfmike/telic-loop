## Tasks
- [x] **1.1**: Verify Astro project configuration: astro.config.mjs has React integration and Tailwind v4 via @tailwindcss/vite plugin, tsconfig.json extends astro/tsconfigs/strict with jsx:react-jsx, package.json has dev/build/preview scripts. Confirm npm run dev starts on port 4321 and npm run build produces dist/ with zero errors. This is brownfield verification -- all config files already exist.
- [x] **1.2**: Verify shadcn/ui component library and blue B2B theme. Confirm globals.css has @import tailwindcss and @theme block with primary blue #1e40af, brand colors, Inter font stack. Verify src/components/ui/ contains all 10 required components: Button, Card, Input, Textarea, Label, NavigationMenu, Sheet, Badge, Separator, Pagination. Confirm src/lib/utils.ts exports cn() utility. Verify components render with correct blue theme on ui-test page.
- [x] **1.3**: Verify BaseLayout.astro provides complete HTML shell: doctype, lang, charset, viewport meta tag, globals.css import, Inter font loading (Google Fonts or system stack), Open Graph meta tags support (og:title, og:description, og:url), canonical URL, and slot for page content. Confirm Header.astro and Footer.astro are included in the layout. Fix any missing head elements.
- [x] **1.4**: Verify Header.astro and MobileNav.tsx: Header displays site logo/brand name, desktop navigation linking all 6 pages (Home, How It Works, Services, About, Blog, Contact) with active route highlighting. MobileNav.tsx is a React island (client:load) using shadcn Sheet component for hamburger menu below 768px. Desktop nav hidden on mobile, hamburger hidden on desktop. Fix any navigation issues.
- [x] **1.5**: Verify Footer.astro: multi-column layout with navigation links to all pages, social media link placeholders (LinkedIn icon + URL), copyright text with dynamic year, and company tagline. Dark background with light text using Tailwind. Footer wired into BaseLayout so it appears on every page. Responsive: stacks to single column on mobile, multi-column grid on desktop.
- [x] **1.6**: Verify Home page (index.astro) placeholder content: hero section with headline, subheadline, CTA button; 6 feature cards with icons, titles, descriptions; BEEP method 4-step preview (Build, Engage, Educate, Promote); 3 testimonial cards with quotes; bottom CTA banner. Confirm page uses BaseLayout, applies blue theme consistently, and responsive grid layout works (1/2/3 columns).
- [x] **1.7**: Verify 4 content pages have appropriate placeholder content. How It Works: 4-step BEEP method (Build, Engage, Educate, Promote) with visual layout and descriptions. Services: 3 service sections (LinkedIn Marketing, Thought Leadership, LinkedIn Training) with benefits lists. About: company story, stats, mission, values. Contact: form placeholder with ContactForm.tsx React island (client:load). All use BaseLayout.
- [x] **1.8**: Verify blog listing page (blog/[...page].astro) with placeholder content: BlogCard.astro component showing image area, title, date, category badges, excerpt. Responsive card grid (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop). Pagination via paginate() with prev/next links. Category filter nav with links to /blog/category/[slug]. Confirm no conflicting blog/index.astro exists.
- [x] **2.1**: Create Sanity Studio project in sanity/ directory. Set up sanity.config.ts with project ID and dataset. Note: Sanity Studio only exposes env vars prefixed SANITY_STUDIO_ to browser code -- either hardcode project ID in config or use SANITY_STUDIO_PROJECT_ID. Create sanity.cli.ts. Add package.json with sanity and @sanity/vision dependencies. Configure npm scripts for sanity dev (port 3333). Use defineConfig from sanity, defineType/defineField for schema API. Verify npx sanity dev launches Studio UI.
- [x] **2.2**: Create 4 Sanity TypeScript schemas in sanity/schemas/: post.ts (title, slug, author ref, publishedAt, categories refs, featuredImage with alt text, excerpt max 200 chars, body as Portable Text), author.ts (name, slug, image, bio), category.ts (title, slug, description), page.ts (title, slug, sections array with hero/features/testimonials/textBlock/cta object types per PRD 2.4). Create schemas/index.ts registering these 4 schemas. Task 2.2b handles the remaining 3 schemas (testimonial, siteSettings, navigation).
- [x] **2.2b**: Create 3 remaining Sanity schemas: testimonial.ts (name required, company optional, role optional, quote required, image optional), siteSettings.ts (title, description, logo, socialLinks object with linkedin/twitter/facebook string fields, footerText, ctaDefaultLink), navigation.ts (items array where each item has label string, href string, optional children array of same shape). Update schemas/index.ts to register all 7 schemas (4 from task 2.2 + these 3). Verify Studio sidebar shows all 7 document types.
- [x] **2.3**: Create Sanity client library at src/lib/sanity.ts. Configure @sanity/client with project ID, dataset, API version, and useCdn:true from env vars. Create GROQ query helpers: getAllPosts (paginated), getPostBySlug, getPostsByCategory, getAllCategories, getPageBySlug, getSiteSettings, getNavigation. Add @sanity/image-url builder for image URLs.
- [x] **2.4**: Wire blog listing page (blog/[...page].astro) to Sanity. Replace placeholder data with real Sanity posts via getAllPosts GROQ query in getStaticPaths. Use paginate() with pageSize:10 to generate /blog, /blog/2, /blog/3 etc. Render BlogCard.astro for each post with real data (featured image via image-url, title, publishedAt formatted date, category Badges, excerpt). Prev/next links from page.url.prev/next.
- [x] **2.5**: Create individual blog post page at blog/[slug].astro (named param, NOT rest param -- rest param [...slug] would conflict with [...page] pagination route). Use getStaticPaths to generate a page per Sanity post slug. Fetch full post data including body (Portable Text), author, categories. Render Portable Text body using astro-portabletext. Display featured image, title, author name, date, category badges. Style for long-form reading with proper typography.
- [x] **2.6**: Create category filter pages at blog/category/[category].astro. Use getStaticPaths to generate a page per Sanity category slug. Fetch posts filtered by category via GROQ. Render same BlogCard grid layout as main blog listing. Display category title as page heading. Add CategoryFilter.tsx React island (or static Astro links) as category nav bar on blog pages.
- [ ] **2.7**: Implement graceful empty-state handling on all CMS-dependent pages. Wrap Sanity fetch calls in try/catch. Blog listing shows No posts yet when empty. Blog post returns 404 gracefully. Category pages show empty message. Home page sections show placeholder when CMS unavailable. Ensure npm run build succeeds when SANITY_PROJECT_ID is empty or invalid.
- [ ] **3.1**: Wire Home page (index.astro) to CMS content. Fetch page data from Sanity using getPageBySlug. Render hero section (headline, subheadline, CTA button), 3-4 feature cards (icon, title, description), BEEP method 4-step preview with link to How It Works, 2-3 testimonial cards from CMS, and bottom CTA banner. Fallback to placeholder content when CMS unavailable.
- [ ] **3.2**: Build How It Works page with 4-step BEEP method visual layout. Each step (Build, Engage, Educate, Promote) has number/icon, heading, 2-3 sentence description. Alternating left/right layout for visual interest. Wire to CMS page content with fallback to hardcoded BEEP descriptions. CTA button at bottom linking to discovery call.
- [ ] **3.3**: Build Services page with 3 service sections on one page: LinkedIn Marketing, Thought Leadership Marketing, LinkedIn Training. Each section has heading, description, key benefits list, and CTA link. Wire to CMS page content with fallback to hardcoded service descriptions. Professional layout with consistent spacing.
- [ ] **3.4**: Build About page (/about) and Contact page (/contact). About page: company story paragraph (founded 2014, members in 22 countries), mission statement, philosophy paragraph on systematic social selling. Wire to CMS getPageBySlug with hardcoded fallback text. CTA button at bottom linking to siteSettings.ctaDefaultLink or fallback URL. Contact page: ContactForm.tsx React island with client:load. 4 fields: name (required, text input), email (required, type=email with regex validation), company (optional, text input), message (required, textarea). On submit: POST JSON body to import.meta.env.PUBLIC_FORM_ACTION. Success state: green text Message sent. Error state: red text Something went wrong. Disable submit button while request is pending.
- [ ] **3.5**: Enhance blog post page with author bio card (name, image, bio text) at bottom and Related Posts section showing 3 posts from the same category. Fetch related posts via GROQ query filtering by shared category, excluding current post. Author bio card uses author reference data already in post query.
- [ ] **3.6**: Implement SEO across all pages. Add page-specific <title> and <meta description> to BaseLayout via props. Add Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url) and canonical URL to every page. Add Organization structured data (JSON-LD) on home page. Install @astrojs/sitemap, configure in astro.config.mjs. Create public/robots.txt allowing all crawlers with sitemap reference.
- [ ] **3.7**: Final build verification and layout consistency check. Run npm run build and confirm exit code 0. Verify in built dist/ output: all routes generate HTML files (index.html, how-it-works/index.html, services/index.html, about/index.html, contact/index.html, blog/index.html). Check every page includes Header and Footer components. Verify Tailwind blue-800 primary color (#1e40af) is applied to headings and CTAs. Fix any build errors, missing imports, or broken component references discovered during verification.
- [x] **VRC-15-gap-1**: Install shadcn Sheet, NavigationMenu, and Pagination components and refactor MobileNav.tsx to use Sheet instead of custom dropdown
- [x] **VRC-15-gap-2**: Add Inter font loading via Google Fonts link in BaseLayout head and update --font-sans in globals.css to use Inter as primary font
- [x] **1.9**: Final build verification and responsive layout check. Run npm run build and confirm zero errors, dist/ contains HTML for all 6 routes (/, /how-it-works, /services, /about, /contact, /blog). Verify responsive behavior: Header desktop nav visible >1024px, hamburger <768px. Cards stack on mobile, grid on tablet/desktop. Footer consistent across pages. Blue theme applied uniformly. Fix any build warnings or layout issues.
