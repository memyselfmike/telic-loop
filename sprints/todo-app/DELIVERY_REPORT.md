## Deliverables
- [DELIVERED] 1.1: Build the complete index.html todo application with all core features: task input with Enter/button submission and empty-input guard, task list display with checkbox toggle and strikethrough styling, delete button per task, three-state filtering (All/Active/Completed) with active filter highlighting and live item count, and localStorage persistence that saves on every mutation and restores on page load. The file must be a single self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JS — no external dependencies, no CDN links, no frameworks. Task data model: {id, text, completed, createdAt}. Newest tasks appear at bottom. Delete button visible on hover (desktop) and always visible (mobile). Responsive design: centered container with max-width 600px on desktop (1024px+), full-width layout on mobile (375px), touch-friendly tap targets of at least 44px height on all interactive elements (checkboxes, buttons, filters), readable font sizes (>=14px body text), and no horizontal scrolling at any viewport width.
- [DELIVERED] 2.1: Create the Playwright test suite (pytest-playwright) that verifies all 7 PRD acceptance criteria against the built index.html. Tests must: (1) serve the file via a local Python http.server fixture (not file:// protocol, to ensure consistent localStorage behavior), (2) use a conftest.py with the server fixture and base_url configuration, and (3) include these test cases: AC1 — page loads with input field and empty list; AC2 — add task via Enter key; AC3 — checkbox toggles strikethrough styling; AC4 — delete button removes task; AC5 — filter buttons show correct subsets (3 tasks: 2 active, 1 completed); AC6 — tasks survive page refresh (localStorage persistence); AC7 — 375px viewport has no horizontal overflow and 44px minimum tap targets. Each test must be independent and not rely on state from other tests.
- [DELIVERED] 2.2: Run the full Playwright test suite and fix any failures found in either the test code or index.html. This task covers the feedback loop: execute tests, analyze failures, fix the root cause (whether in the app or the tests), and re-run until all tests pass green. Common issues to watch for: selector mismatches between test expectations and actual DOM structure, timing issues requiring proper Playwright waits (use expect/locator auto-waiting, not sleep), and localStorage serialization edge cases.
- [DELIVERED] CE-5-3: Either: (a) increase the checkbox CSS dimensions to 44x44px on mobile via the existing @media (max-width: 768px) breakpoint, or (b) make the entire task-item row clickable to toggle completion (add a click handler on the li element that triggers toggleTask), or (c) wrap the checkbox in a label element that extends the clickable area to cover the task text.
- [DELIVERED] EVAL-1: Fix mobile checkbox tap targets: increase from 22x22px to at least 44x44px on viewports 768px and below. The checkbox is the primary interaction element for completing tasks, and at 22x22px it fails the PRD requirement of 44px minimum tap targets. Options: (a) increase checkbox CSS dimensions in the mobile media query, (b) wrap checkbox and text in a clickable label element, or (c) add a click handler to the task-item row. Approach (b) is recommended as it also improves desktop usability.
