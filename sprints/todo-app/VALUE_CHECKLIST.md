## VRC Status
- Value Score: 100%
- Verified: 7/7
- Blocked: 0
- Recommendation: SHIP_READY
- Summary: Iteration 4 QUICK VRC: No change from iteration 3. Value score holds at 100% (7/7 verified). All planned work complete: index.html with full feature set (1.1), comprehensive Playwright test suite (2.1), and passing test execution (2.2). No iteration 4 execution activity, but this is expected - all value has been delivered and verified. The app is ready for production use: developer opens index.html in any browser, zero setup required, immediately can add/complete/filter/delete tasks with full localStorage persistence and mobile responsiveness (375px tested). SHIP_READY remains the correct recommendation.

## Tasks
- [x] **1.1**: Build the complete index.html todo application with all core features: task input with Enter/button submission and empty-input guard, task list display with checkbox toggle and strikethrough styling, delete button per task, three-state filtering (All/Active/Completed) with active filter highlighting and live item count, and localStorage persistence that saves on every mutation and restores on page load. The file must be a single self-contained HTML file with embedded CSS and JS — no external dependencies, no CDN links, no frameworks. Task data model: {id, text, completed, createdAt}. Newest tasks appear at bottom. Delete button visible on hover (desktop) and always visible (mobile). Responsive design: centered container with max-width 600px on desktop (1024px+), full-width layout on mobile (375px), touch-friendly tap targets of at least 44px height on all interactive elements (checkboxes, buttons, filters), readable font sizes (>=14px body text), and no horizontal scrolling at any viewport width.
- [x] **2.1**: Create the Playwright test suite (pytest-playwright) that verifies all 7 PRD acceptance criteria against the built index.html. Tests must: (1) serve the file via a local Python http.server fixture (not file:// protocol, to ensure consistent localStorage behavior), (2) use a conftest.py with the server fixture and base_url configuration, and (3) include these test cases: AC1 — page loads with input field and empty list; AC2 — add task via Enter key; AC3 — checkbox toggles strikethrough styling; AC4 — delete button removes task; AC5 — filter buttons show correct subsets (3 tasks: 2 active, 1 completed); AC6 — tasks survive page refresh (localStorage persistence); AC7 — 375px viewport has no horizontal overflow and 44px minimum tap targets. Each test must be independent and not rely on state from other tests.
- [x] **2.2**: Run the full Playwright test suite and fix any failures found in either the test code or index.html. This task covers the feedback loop: execute tests, analyze failures, fix the root cause (whether in the app or the tests), and re-run until all tests pass green. Common issues to watch for: selector mismatches between test expectations and actual DOM structure, timing issues requiring proper Playwright waits (use expect/locator auto-waiting, not sleep), and localStorage serialization edge cases.
