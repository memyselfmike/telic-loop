# Implementation Plan (rendered from state)

Generated: 2026-02-17T10:58:48.606390


## Foundation

- [ ] **1.1**: Create the foundational HTML file with dark-themed board layout: three columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) displayed side-by-side with flexbox, column headers with card count badges, add-card buttons, scrollable card areas, search bar, priority filter row, and responsive breakpoints (desktop >= 1024px, tablet 768-1023px, mobile < 768px stacking vertically). Apply the exact dark color scheme from PRD Section 10.1 (background #0d1117, columns #161b22, cards #21262d, text #e6edf3/#8b949e, accent #58a6ff, borders #30363d). Use system font stack per Section 10.2 with WCAG AA compliant contrast (bump label text color to #9da5ae for 4.5:1 ratio on #21262d). File: sprints/kanban/index.html with all CSS inline in a <style> block.
  - Value: Enables the user to open the file and immediately see a professional, dark-themed Kanban board with three clear columns — the visual foundation that makes all subsequent interaction possible.
  - Acceptance: Opening index.html in a browser shows three side-by-side columns titled To Do, In Progress, Done with (0) count badges, + buttons, a search bar at top, and priority filter buttons below it. At 375px viewport width, columns stack vertically. Dark theme colors match PRD spec. All text meets WCAG AA contrast.

- [ ] **1.2**: Implement the data model and localStorage persistence layer in the inline JavaScript. Define the board state schema exactly as PRD Section 6.4 specifies: {columns: [{id, name, cardIds}], cards: {cardId: {id, title, description, priority, labels, created}}}. Implement: (1) loadState() that reads from localStorage key kanban_board_state, falls back to empty 3-column board if missing/corrupted, (2) saveState() that synchronously writes to localStorage on every mutation, (3) generateId() for unique card IDs, (4) a render() function that rebuilds the DOM from state (column cards, count badges, etc.). Wire saveState() into every state mutation path.
  - Value: Enables the user to trust that nothing is lost — every change persists immediately and survives page reload, which is the core trust promise of the Vision.
  - Acceptance: After creating cards via console (or later via UI), refreshing the page restores all cards in their correct columns. If localStorage is cleared, the board loads empty without errors. Corrupted JSON in localStorage results in empty board, not a crash.
  - Deps: 1.1


## Core

- [ ] **2.1**: Implement card creation: clicking the + button on any column shows an inline form at the top of that columns card list with an auto-focused title input. Pressing Enter creates a card with the typed title (max 100 chars), medium priority default, no labels, current timestamp as created date, and adds it to the top of that column. Pressing Escape cancels and hides the form. The new card renders immediately showing title (14px semibold), priority border (medium = #d29922 left border), and created date (small muted timestamp). Card creation slide-down animation (150ms). Save state after creation.
  - Value: Enables the user to add tasks to their board fluidly — the core write interaction that makes the board useful rather than just a static display.
  - Acceptance: Clicking + on To Do column shows a title input at the top. Typing a title and pressing Enter creates a card that appears with the title, yellow left border (medium priority), and a timestamp. The card persists after page reload. Pressing Escape without typing dismisses the form with no card created.
  - Deps: 1.2

- [ ] **2.2**: Implement card editing via modal overlay: clicking a card opens a modal with (1) editable title field, (2) editable description textarea (plain text), (3) priority selector (dropdown or radio: low/medium/high/urgent), (4) label manager with text input to add new labels and existing labels shown as removable colored chips (auto-assigned colors from a palette), (5) Delete button with confirmation dialog, (6) Close button. Changes save on every field blur or Enter — not just on close. Modal opens with opacity fade (200ms). Modal traps focus when open. Clicking outside modal closes it. All aria-labels on icon-only buttons. Save state after every field change.
  - Value: Enables the user to enrich their cards with descriptions, priorities, and labels — transforming simple titles into organized, scannable task information.
  - Acceptance: Clicking a card opens a centered modal overlay. Editing the title and blurring saves immediately (visible after modal close). Changing priority changes the card left border color. Adding a label shows as a colored chip on both the modal and the card. Delete button shows confirmation before removing. Tab key cycles within the modal. Escape closes the modal.
  - Deps: 2.1

- [ ] **2.3**: Implement drag-and-drop for cards between columns with both mouse and touch support: MOUSE: (1) mousedown+move on a card initiates drag — card becomes semi-transparent (opacity 0.5) at original position, a visual clone follows the cursor using CSS transforms (translateX/Y) for 60fps performance, (2) while dragging, show a dashed-border placeholder at valid drop positions (between cards, top/bottom of columns, empty columns), (3) on mouseup over a valid target, move the card to that position in state and re-render, (4) on mouseup outside valid targets, card returns to original position. Use CSS transforms exclusively for the dragged element — no position/left/top manipulation that triggers layout reflow. TOUCH: (5) long-press (300ms hold) on a card initiates drag on touch devices using touchstart/touchmove/touchend events, (6) same visual feedback as mouse — semi-transparent origin, clone follows finger via CSS transforms, dashed placeholders at drop targets, (7) touchmove updates clone position and evaluates drop targets, touchend completes drop or returns to original, (8) prevent default on touch events during drag to avoid scroll interference, normal scrolling works when not dragging. Build a shared drag engine (clone positioning, placeholder management, drop target evaluation, state mutation) used by both mouse and touch handlers. Save state after successful drop.
  - Value: Enables the user to organize their workflow by moving cards between columns with natural, fluid drag interaction on both desktop (mouse) and tablet/mobile (touch) — the defining interaction of a Kanban board, working everywhere.
  - Acceptance: MOUSE: Dragging a card from To Do shows a semi-transparent original and a clone following the cursor. Drop zones appear as dashed placeholders between cards. Dropping into In Progress moves the card there. Dropping outside any column returns card to original position. No visible jank during drag. TOUCH: On a touch device (or touch emulation in devtools), long-pressing a card for 300ms initiates drag. The card clone follows the finger. Dropping onto another column moves the card. Touch scrolling still works when not dragging a card. BOTH: State persists after drop.
  - Deps: 2.1

- [ ] **2.5**: Implement search and filtering: (1) Search bar at top of board with search icon and placeholder Search cards... — typing filters cards in real-time (debounced 150ms) by case-insensitive substring match on title, description, and labels. Non-matching cards get display:none. Column headers and structure remain. Card count badges update to show filtered count. (2) Priority filter row below search: toggle buttons for All, Low, Medium, High, Urgent. Clicking one filters to that priority. All shows everything. Active filter visually highlighted with accent color. (3) Label filter: clicking a label chip on any card filters to that label, shown as removable chip in filter bar. (4) All filters combine with AND logic. (5) Clear filters button appears when any filter is active, resets all. (6) Filter transitions: opacity fade on cards (150ms).
  - Value: Enables the user to find cards quickly and focus on what matters — critical when the board grows beyond a handful of tasks.
  - Acceptance: Typing in search bar hides non-matching cards within 150ms. Count badges show filtered count. Priority filter buttons highlight when active and show only matching cards. Clicking a label chip filters to that label. Clear filters button resets all filters. Filters combine with AND logic (search + priority + label).
  - Deps: 2.2

- [ ] **2.6**: Implement single-level undo system: (1) Before every state mutation (card create, delete, move, edit), snapshot the current state as lastAction with enough info to reverse it. (2) Ctrl+Z (or Cmd+Z on Mac) restores the previous state from the snapshot. (3) After undo, show a notification at the bottom of the screen (e.g. Undo: moved card) that auto-dismisses after 3 seconds with slide-up + fade-out animation. (4) Only one level of undo — no redo, no history stack. (5) If no action to undo, Ctrl+Z does nothing. (6) Undo of card deletion restores the card to its original column and position.
  - Value: Enables the user to recover from mistakes instantly — especially accidental card moves or deletions — building confidence and trust in the tool.
  - Acceptance: After moving a card from To Do to Done, pressing Ctrl+Z moves it back to To Do. After deleting a card, Ctrl+Z restores it. A notification appears at the bottom showing what was undone and disappears after 3 seconds. Pressing Ctrl+Z with nothing to undo has no effect.
  - Deps: 2.2, 2.3

- [ ] **2.7**: Implement keyboard shortcuts: (1) N key opens new card form in the first column (To Do) — equivalent to clicking the + button on To Do, (2) / key focuses the search input, (3) Escape closes the edit modal, cancels card creation form, and clears search, (4) Ctrl+Z / Cmd+Z triggers undo (already implemented in 2.6, just ensure it is wired). All shortcuts must NOT fire when a text input or textarea is focused (except Escape which always works). Implement by listening on document keydown with checks for event.target tagName.
  - Value: Enables power users to manage the board efficiently without touching the mouse — reducing friction for the developer audience who lives on the keyboard.
  - Acceptance: With no input focused: pressing N opens the card creation form on To Do, pressing / focuses the search bar. With a text input focused: pressing N types the letter, not triggering the shortcut. Escape closes an open modal. Escape in search clears the search text.
  - Deps: 2.1, 2.5, 2.6


## Integration

- [ ] **3.1**: Integration and polish pass on the complete index.html: (1) Verify all features work together — create card, edit it with labels/priority, drag between columns, search, filter, undo, keyboard shortcuts. (2) Ensure all animations are present: card creation slide-down 150ms, modal fade 200ms, filter opacity fade 150ms, undo notification slide-up + fade-out. (3) Verify accessibility: all interactive elements focusable via Tab, modal focus trap, aria-labels on +/delete/close buttons, WCAG AA contrast (label text #9da5ae on #21262d). (4) Verify file size is under 30KB — if over, apply PRD descoping priority: reduce animation variety first, simplify touch drag second, reduce undo scope third. (5) Ensure no console errors during all interactions. (6) Test responsive behavior at 1024px, 768px, and 375px.
  - Value: Ensures the complete board works as an integrated whole, not just as isolated features — the user experience is the product of all features working together seamlessly.
  - Acceptance: File size of index.html is under 30KB (verified via stat or wc -c). All features work without console.error messages during any interaction. Tab navigation reaches all interactive elements. Modal traps focus (Tab from last element returns to first). aria-labels present on +, delete, and close buttons. Card creation animates in 150ms, modal fades in 200ms, filter transitions in 150ms (verified by presence of CSS transition/animation rules with those durations). Board is usable at 1024px, 768px, and 375px viewport widths (columns side-by-side at 1024 and 768, stacked at 375).

## Verification

- [ ] **4.1**: Create Playwright end-to-end test suite in sprints/kanban/tests/. Create conftest.py with a fixture that starts a Python HTTP server (http.server) serving sprints/kanban/ on a dynamic port (use port 0 to get an OS-assigned free port), waits for readiness, yields the base URL, and tears it down after tests. All test files use this base_url fixture instead of hardcoded ports. Create test files covering all PRD Section 11 requirements: (1) test_board_structure.py - board loads with three empty columns with names To Do, In Progress, Done and (0) count badges. (2) test_card_crud.py - create card via + button and Enter, verify it appears with title and yellow left border; open card modal, edit title/description/priority/labels, verify changes persist; delete card with confirmation dialog, verify it disappears. (3) test_drag_drop.py - create a card in To Do, drag it to In Progress using Playwright low-level mouse API (NOT page.drag_and_drop which uses HTML5 Drag API). The correct sequence for custom mousedown/mousemove/mouseup drag handlers is: get source card bounding box center, call page.mouse.move(source_x, source_y), then page.mouse.down(), then page.mouse.move(target_x, target_y, steps=10) to generate intermediate mousemove events that trigger drag mode, then page.mouse.up(). The steps parameter is critical -- without intermediate moves the custom drag handler will not activate. Verify card is now in In Progress column. (4) test_search_filter.py - create 3+ cards with different titles/priorities, type in search bar, verify only matching cards visible; click priority filter button, verify only matching priority cards visible; click clear filters, verify all cards visible. (5) test_persistence.py - create cards, call page.reload(), verify cards still present with same titles and columns. (6) test_keyboard.py - press N, verify card creation form appears in To Do; press /, verify search input is focused; open modal then press Escape, verify modal closes; create card then press Ctrl+Z, verify card is removed (undone). (7) test_responsive.py - set viewport to 1024x768, verify columns are side-by-side (check computed flex-direction or column x-positions); set viewport to 375x667, verify columns are stacked (all columns have same x-position or full width). (8) Every test registers a page.on(console) listener that collects messages where type is error. At end of each test, assert no console errors were captured (console.log and console.warn are allowed).
  - Value: Provides automated proof that all promised user value is actually delivered — catches regressions and proves the board works end-to-end before shipping.
  - Acceptance: Running pytest sprints/kanban/tests/ executes all tests. Tests start their own HTTP server. All tests pass against the completed index.html. Tests cover: board structure, card CRUD, drag-and-drop, search, priority filter, persistence, keyboard shortcuts, responsive layout, and no console errors.
