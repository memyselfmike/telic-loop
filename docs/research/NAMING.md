# Naming: The Telic Loop

## The Problem with "Loop V3"

Through Sprint 2 of the Jean-Claude AiEA project, we developed an increasingly sophisticated autonomous delivery system referred to as "the loop." As the V3 design matured — incorporating vision validation, process meta-reasoning, emergent coherence evaluation, epic decomposition, and human feedback integration — it became clear that "loop v3" drastically undersold what this system actually is.

We needed a name that reflected the true nature of the system: a multi-layered, self-correcting, purpose-directed algorithm that takes a vision and autonomously delivers verified value.

## What We're Describing

This is not a dev tool or a code generator. It is a **closed-loop value delivery algorithm** that:

- Takes Vision + PRD and autonomously delivers the promised outcome
- Self-configures (discovers tech stack, verification strategy, deliverable type)
- Self-diagnoses (recognizes when stuck, changes strategy — not just plan)
- Self-corrects (course correction, process meta-reasoning)
- Self-evaluates (QC, critical evaluation, VRC heartbeat, coherence analysis)
- Orchestrates specialized agent roles through a deterministic decision engine
- Researches externally when its knowledge is insufficient
- Has exactly one exit condition: **verified value**
- Is technology-agnostic and deliverable-agnostic

We see this as a key building block for a **GAO (Generative Autonomous Organisation)** — every autonomous unit in a GAO needs the ability to take intent and produce verified outcomes.

## How We Arrived at "Telic Loop"

### The Search

We explored naming across several directions:

**Classical/philosophical roots:**
- **Telos** (τέλος) — purpose, end, aim (Aristotle's "final cause")
- **Praxis** (πρᾶξις) — theory into action (Marx, Freire)
- **Nous** (νοῦς) — the highest form of intellect
- **Ergon** (ἔργον) — work, characteristic function
- **Poiesis** (ποίησις) — the act of bringing something into being

**Metaphorical:**
- **Forge** — iterative transformation through heat and pressure
- **Loom** — weaving many threads into a coherent whole
- **Crucible** — transformation and verification through intensity
- **Helix** — spiral progression upward with each iteration

**Agency/autonomy:**
- **Demiurge** — Plato's craftsman who shapes reality from an ideal form
- **Daemon** — an autonomous background process (computing) / guiding spirit (Greek)

### The Decision

We didn't need a brand. We needed a **descriptor** — a way to name the pattern itself, the way "OODA loop" or "Deming cycle" names a pattern of operation.

**Telos** resonated immediately as the right root concept. The entire system exists to fulfill the purpose defined in the Vision. Every layer of reasoning — VRC, QC, critical evaluation, coherence analysis, meta-reasoning — exists to ensure the telos is achieved.

The natural adjective form is **telic** — meaning "directed toward a definite end or purpose." In linguistics, a telic action has a natural completion point ("build a house") as opposed to an atelic one ("walk around"). This is precisely what distinguishes this system from a generic feedback loop or iterative process: it is **purpose-directed**, with a defined endpoint of verified value delivery.

### The Name

**The Telic Loop** — a purpose-directed cycle that iterates with multiple layers of reasoning until the defined purpose (vision) is verifiably fulfilled.

## Why It Works

**As a descriptor:**
- "Run the telic loop against this sprint"
- "The telic loop's exit gate caught three gaps"
- "The pre-loop qualified the vision before the telic loop began"

**In the GAO context:**
- Every autonomous unit runs a telic loop — purpose in, verified outcome out
- The telic loop is the execution primitive of a generative autonomous organisation

**Philosophically:**
- Rooted in Aristotle's concept of telos (final cause / inherent purpose)
- A telic loop is one that moves toward fulfillment, not one that merely iterates
- The opposite of aimless cycling — every iteration is purpose-directed

## Etymology

- **Telic**: from Greek τελικός (telikos), "of or relating to an end or purpose"
- **Telos**: from Greek τέλος (telos), "end, purpose, aim, goal, completion"
- Aristotle's four causes: material, formal, efficient, and **final (telos)** — the purpose for which a thing exists
