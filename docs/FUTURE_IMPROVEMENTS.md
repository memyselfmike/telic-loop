# Future Improvements

## Project-Aware Loop (IMPLEMENTED)

Added `project_dir` concept to separate application code (project root) from loop management artifacts (sprint directory). See `config.py:effective_project_dir`. Usage: `telic-loop <sprint> --project-dir /path/to/project`.

## Pre-compute Context Discovery Inputs (IMPLEMENTED)

Pre-computes tool versions, project markers, file tree with line counts, test file detection, and service indicators in Python before the LLM session. Data injected into `discover_context.md` prompt via `{PRECOMPUTED_ENV}` placeholder. Steps 2/4/5 simplified to reference pre-computed data. Expected reduction: ~30 turns → ~5 turns.

See `discovery.py:_precompute_environment()` and helpers.
